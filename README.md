# restaurant-page
A simple restaurant page to work with dom manipulation and webpack done with spec from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-restaurant-page) and inspired by [this sketch](https://vimeo.com/552164990)

## Instructions
To view the site here is a [live version](https://qpongratz.github.io/restaurant-page/), or you can download the repository and run `npm install` for the required node modules and open the index.html file located in the dist folder.

## Tools Used
- npm
- webpack
- html
- css
- scss

## Notes

- It was interesting to build a website from almost all javascript.
- It was neat to build functions to help me abstract some of the work of creating the different elements needed. Give more time or more need to build stuff out like that, I could see building out a whole suite of functions to build various little components of the site, and I imagine that's sort of the direction future projects will go in.
- Having the dom element creation functions in their own module will make it convenient if I need to reuse those types of functions to just port the whole thing over to a new project without much hassle.
- My image management is not good here, but it wasn't the point of the lesson. The initial load is a bit much for the background since it's such a large file. A better way to do that would be with a CDN for hosting the images, but it's just out of the scope of this project.
- I had used sass before, and i had liked it, but was just using vanilla css for projects recently, but now with webpack its easy to integrate that back into my workflow. Though now I may experiment with other css processors with webpack in my pocket.
